NAME
profile-cleaner - Reduce the size of browser and some email program's profiles by organizing their sqlite databases using sqlite3's vacuum and reindex functions. The term "browser" is used loosely since profile-cleaner happily works on some email clients too.

SYNOPSIS
profile-cleaner [option]

DESCRIPTION
Profile-cleaner is a very simple shell script that will invoke sqlite3 to vacuum and reindex databases belonging to supported browsers and email clients. It is compatible with profile-sync-daemon so users need not stop psd before calling profile-cleaner. In fact, profiles will clean much faster when they are synced to tmpfs via psd.

OPTIONS
	b   Clean brave's profile

	c   Clean chromium's profile

	ck  Clean conkeror's profile(s)*

	e   Clean edge's profile

	f   Clean firefox's profile(s)*

	fa  Clean falkon's profile

	gc  Clean google-chrome's profile

	h   Clean heftig aurora's profile(s)*

	i   Clean icecat's profile(s)*

	id  Clean icedove's profile

	ix  Clean Inox's profile

	l   Clean Librewolf's profile

	m   Clean midori's profile

	o   Clean opera's profile

	t   Clean thunderbird's profile(s)*

	to  Clean tor-browser's profile

	s   Clean seamonkey's profile(s)*

	pm  Clean palemoon's profile(s)*

	p   Clean the defined paths

	v   Clean vivaldi's profile

	z   Clean zen's profile(s)*


*Profile-cleaner will parse the respective profiles.ini file and clean all profiles defined therein.

CONFIG FILE
Profile-cleaner will create $HOME/.config/profile-cleaner.conf the first time it is invoked. Users may define a color scheme therein based on their terminal background color. The default is a dark scheme for dark colored terminals. The file is commented and self-explanatory.

EXAMPLES
Clean all firefox profiles:


 $ profile-cleaner f

Clean chromium profile:


 $ profile-cleaner c

Clean the user defined profile:


 $ profile-cleaner p /path/to/profile
